  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>JGraphT is a free Java class library that provides mathematical
  graph-theory objects and algorithms. It runs on Java 2 Platform
  (requires JDK 1.6 or later).</p>

  <p>JGraphT is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License (LGPL). A copy of the <a href="license-LGPL.txt">license</a> is
  included in the download.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <p>The package <code>org.jgrapht.demo</code> includes small demo
  applications to help you get started. If you spawn your own demo app and
  think others can use it, please send it to us and we will add it to that
  package.</p>

  <h2>Upgrading Versions</h2>

  <p>To help upgrading, JGraphT maintains a one-version-backwards
  compatibility. While this compatibility is not a hard promise, it is generally
  respected. (This policy was not followed for the jump from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0
  due to the pervasive changes required for generics.) You can upgrade via:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b>The safe way</b> : compile your app with the JGraphT
      version that immediately follows your existing version and
      follow the deprecation notes, if they exist, and modify your
      application accordingly. Then move to the next version, and on,
      until you're current.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><b>The fast way</b> : go to the latest JGraphT right away - if it
      works, you're done.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Reading the <a href="#history">change history</a> is always
  recommended.</p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>

  <p>A local copy of the Javadoc HTML files is included in this distribution.
  The latest version of these files is also available on-line at <a href=
  "http://www.jgrapht.org/javadoc">http://www.jgrapht.org/javadoc</a>.</p>

    added, edge API refactored to be simpler, an improved ant build, an
    improved event model, all known bugs were fixed, documentation
    clarifications, other small improvements. API of 0.5.0 is not 100% backward
    compatible with 0.4.1 but upgrade is simple and straightforward.</li>

    <li><b>version 0.4.1</b> (05-Aug-2003) : A new adapter to JGraph that
    provides graph visualizations, new depth-first and breadth-first iteration
    algorithms, various bug fixes and refactoring, moved unit-tests to a
    separate folder hierarchy and added more unit-tests.</li>
